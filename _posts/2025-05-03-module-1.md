title: "Module 1: Foundations of LLMs, Prompting, and Agent Fundamentals"
layout: post
---

In this module, we explore the foundational concepts and practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompting techniques, and agent fundamentals. Key topics include understanding what agents are, how LLMs function, and the basics of prompt engineering. We also delve into LangChain, tools for agent environments, and the Thought-Action-Observation cycle.

Hands-on exercises provide opportunities to practice building agents and applying the Thought-Action-Observation cycle. Complementary resources, such as research papers, tutorials, and interactive tools, are provided to deepen understanding and enhance learning.

By the end of this module, you will have a solid grasp of LLMs, prompting strategies, and the essential components of agent-based systems.
