Welcome to the first module of our AI Agent Development course! Before diving into creating intelligent agents, we need to set up our development environment. This guide will walk you through installing and configuring all the necessary tools you'll need throughout this course.

If you already have experience with Python development and have some of these tools installed (VS Code, Git, Jupyter Notebook), feel free to skip the sections you're familiar with. Just make sure everything is properly set up and working in your development environment before starting the course. You can use the "Testing Your Setup" section at the end to verify everything is working correctly.

## What You'll Need

As we build AI agents, you'll be working with:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for AI development
- **Visual Studio Code**: A powerful code editor with excellent Python support
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive code development and experimentation  
- **Git**: For version control and code sharing

Let's go through each component step by step.

## 1. Installing Python

<div style="display: flex; gap: 0px; flex-wrap: wrap; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 100vw; max-width: 100vw;">
    <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/images/python_download.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Python Download"
            style="width: 300px; height: 150px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 12px;" />
    </a>
</div>

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/python_download.png' | relative_url }}" alt="MIT GenAI"
         style="width: 300px; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px;" />
  </a>

  <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/python_download.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Oracle AI vs GenAI vs ML"
         style="width: 300px; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px;" />
  </a>
</div>


<div style="display: flex;">
    <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/images/python_download.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Python Download"
            style="width: 300px; height: 350px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 12px;" />
    </a>
</div>

<div style="display: flex;">
    <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/images/python_download.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Python Download"
            style="width: 400px; height: 450px; object-fit: fill; border-radius: 12px;" />
    </a>
</div>

After installation, verify Python is correctly installed by opening your command line or terminal and typing:

```shell
python --version # Windows
python3 --version # MacOS/Linux
```

You should see the Python version number displayed.

## 2. Setting Up Virtual Environments

Virtual environments are isolated spaces where you can install packages without affecting other Python projects. This is crucial for AI development where different projects may require different library versions.

### Installing and Creating a Virtual Environment

When activated, you'll see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

## 3. Installing Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful code editor with excellent Python support.

- Visit the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Essential VS Code Extensions for AI Development

Install these extensions from the Extensions view `Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`:

- **Python** by Microsoft: For Python language support
- **Jupyter**: For working with Jupyter notebooks directly in VS Code
- **Pylance**: Enhanced language server for Python

---

## 4. Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks allow you to create and share documents containing live code, visualizations, and narrative text.

## 6. Installing Git

Git is an essential tool for version control and collaboration, enabling developers to track changes in their codebase, revert to previous versions, work on multiple features simultaneously through branches, and collaborate seamlessly with other team members through platforms like GitHub.

### Windows

<div style="display: flex; gap: 0px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/git_download.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Git Download"
         style="width: 300px; height: 200px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 0px;" />
  </a>
</div>

### MacOS/Linux
```shell
brew install git # MacOS
sudo apt install git # Linux
```

### Configure Git
```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## 7. Testing Your Setup

Let's make sure everything is working properly by creating a simple test in you Jupyter Notebook:

{% highlight python %}

import sys

# Confirm Python is running correctly
print(f"[Dandilyonn Bootloader] Python detected: {sys.version.split()[0]} ðŸŒ±")

def activate_seedling_agent():
    print("\nðŸŒ¿ Initializing AI Agent Prototype: 'Seedling-01' under Project Dandilyonn...")
    
    # Simulated agent capabilities
    skills = ["reasoning", "retrieval", "tool use", "streaming output"]
    print(f"ðŸ§  Core capabilities loaded: {', '.join(skills)}")
    
    # Agent personality config
    agent_name = "Seedling-01"
    if "Seed" in agent_name:
        print(f"ðŸ¤– Agent '{agent_name}' recognized as part of early-stage growth units.")
    else:
        print(f"ðŸ¤– Agent '{agent_name}' does not follow standard naming conventions.")
    
    # Memory warmup
    recent_memories = ["Completed Langchain walkthrough", "Integrated vector search", "Deployed Streamlit prototype"]
    print("ðŸª´ Recent memory log:")
    for mem in recent_memories:
        print(f"  - {mem}")
    
    # Mission assignment
    mission = "Assist developers in building modular, stateful AI workflows with elegance."
    print(f"ðŸŽ¯ Mission assigned: {mission}")

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}

# Trigger the agent simulation
activate_seedling_agent()

{% endhighlight %}

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Python Not Found After Installation
- **Windows**: Ensure Python is added to `PATH`
- **macOS/Linux**: Make sure you're using `python3` command

### Package Installation Failures
- Make sure your virtual environment is activated
- Try updating pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`

## 9. What's Next?

Now that you have your development environment set up, you're ready to begin exploring AI agent development! In the upcoming modules, we'll:

1. Learn about fundamental concepts in AI agent development
2. Explore Large Language Models and their capabilities
3. Create your first simple AI agent
4. Connect agents to external tools and data sources
5. Build more complex, multi-agent systems
