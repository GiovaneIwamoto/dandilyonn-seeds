Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze.

AI is a broad field that encompasses many different disciplines, including computer science, data analytics and statistics, hardware and software engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy and psychology. 
On an operational level for business use, AI is a set of technologies that are based primarily on machine learning and deep learning, used for data analytics, predictions and forecasting, object categorization, natural language processing, recommendations, intelligent data retrieval, and more.

### 2.2 Generative vs. Discriminative Models

Gain a deeper understanding of the conceptual and practical differences between generative models, which are designed to create new data samples that resemble the training data, and discriminative models, which focus on classifying or predicting labels based on input data. This distinction is fundamental to understanding how different types of AI models approach problem-solving and content generation.

### 2.3 The most popular generative AI applications

**Language**: Text is at the root of many generative AI models and is considered to be the most advanced domain. One of the most popular examples of language-based generative models are called large language models (LLMs). Large language models are being leveraged for a wide variety of tasks, including essay generation, code development, translation, and even understanding genetic sequences.

**Audio**: Music, audio, and speech are also emerging fields within generative AI. Examples include models being able to develop songs and snippets of audio clips with text inputs, recognize objects in videos and create accompanying noises for different video footage, and even create custom music.

**Visual**: One of the most popular applications of generative AI is within the realm of images. This encompasses the creation of 3D images, avatars, videos, graphs, and other illustrations. There’s flexibility in generating images with different aesthetic styles, as well as techniques for editing and modifying generated visuals. Generative AI models can create graphs that show new chemical compounds and molecules that aid in drug discovery, create realistic images for virtual or augmented reality, produce 3D models for video games, design logos, enhance or edit existing images, and more.

**Synthetic data**: Synthetic data is extremely useful to train AI models when data doesn’t exist, is restricted, or is simply unable to address corner cases with the highest accuracy. The development of synthetic data through generative models is perhaps one of the most impactful solutions for overcoming the data challenges of many enterprises. It spans all modalities and use cases and is possible through a process called label efficient learning. Generative AI models can reduce labeling costs by either automatically producing additional augmented training data or by learning an internal representation of the data that facilitates training AI models with less labeled data.

The impact of generative models is wide-reaching, and its applications are only growing. Listed are just a few examples of how generative AI is helping to advance and transform the fields of transportation, natural sciences, and entertainment.

In the automotive industry, generative AI is expected to help create 3D worlds and models for simulations and car development. Synthetic data is also being used to train autonomous vehicles. Being able to road test the abilities of an autonomous vehicle in a realistic 3D world improves safety, efficiency, and flexibility while decreasing risk and overhead.

The field of natural sciences greatly benefits from generative AI. In the healthcare industry, generative models can aid in medical research by developing new protein sequences to aid in drug discovery. Practitioners can also benefit from the automation of tasks such as scribing, medical coding, medical imaging, and genomic analysis. Meanwhile, in the weather industry, generative models can be used to create simulations of the planet and help with accurate weather forecasting and natural disaster prediction. These applications can help to create safer environments for the general population and allow scientists to predict and better prepare for natural disasters.

All aspects of the entertainment industry, from video games to film, animation, world building, and virtual reality, are able to leverage generative AI models to help streamline their content creation process. Creators are using generative models as a tool to help supplement their creativity and work.

## 3. Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Delve into the fascinating challenge of teaching machines to understand and generate human language—exploring why this problem is uniquely difficult and how modern approaches are achieving breakthrough capabilities. 

Note: While the linked tutorials may contain coding examples, for this module you should focus on understanding the concepts and challenges of NLP rather than implementing code. The goal is to develop a strong conceptual foundation of why language processing is difficult for machines before attempting technical implementations in future modules.

## 4. Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models are at the core of modern generative AI and agents. These models are trained on massive amounts of text data and use deep learning (typically transformers) to generate human-like responses to natural language inputs.

## 5. Chat Templates and Interaction Patterns

Before building agents, it's critical to understand how LLMs are structured to follow instructions in conversation.

https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter11/2

https://docs.gpt4all.io/gpt4all_desktop/chat_templates.html

### 5.1 Role-Based Message Formatting

Modern LLMs often use structured prompts with role-based messages:

```json
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "How does photosynthesis work?"}
]
```

### 5.2 Templates in OpenAI and LangChain

Templates abstract these message formats for reuse, enabling structured instruction-following for agents.
