In this module, learners will explore the core frameworks used to build AI agents, focusing on practical tools such as LangChain, smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph. The module begins with essential LangChain components and patterns, followed by a comparative study of agent frameworks, and concludes with hands-on use cases and a final project. By the end of the module, learners will be equipped to design, implement, and evaluate intelligent agents using modern tools and best practices.

## 1. LangChain Components and Patterns

Before diving into agent-specific frameworks, it is important to understand the core components provided by LangChain. These tools form the foundation for building applications powered by language models.

### Topics:

* Document loaders and text splitters
* Vector stores and embeddings
* Memory types and conversation management
* Chains and sequential processing

### Key Resources:

* [LangChain Concepts](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/) – Core modules and components
* [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/) – Building blocks for chains
* [LangChain Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/) – Guided examples for specific use cases
* [Pinecone Vector Database Guide](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/) – Understanding vector stores

### Practical Projects:

* Build a document-based QA system with memory
* Create a chain that processes structured data
* Implement a conversational agent with state management

## 2. Frameworks for AI Agents

This section introduces key frameworks used to build and manage agents. Each framework offers a unique approach to implementing intelligent agent workflows.

### Topics Covered:

* Overview of popular AI agent frameworks: smolagents, LangGraph, and LlamaIndex
* Deep dive into each framework:

  * **smolagents** – Building lightweight agents
  * **LlamaIndex** – Creating agents over custom data using indexes and workflows
  * **LangGraph** – Developing production-ready agents with fine-grained control over execution flow

## 3. Use Cases

In this phase, learners apply what they’ve studied to real-world applications, focusing on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and integrating external tools into agents.

### Objective:

Build real-life use cases using RAG pipelines and tool-augmented agents.

## 4. Final Assignment

To consolidate the skills acquired, the final task involves designing, implementing, and evaluating an agent tailored to a specific benchmark or task.

### Objective:

Build and test a complete agent solution for a selected use case or benchmark.
