title: "Module 2: Chains, Parsers, Memory"
layout: post
---

Explore key components that allow LangChain to build sophisticated and dynamic workflows, such as chains that link multiple LLM calls or tools in sequence, parsers that interpret and structure raw LLM outputs into usable formats, and memory that maintains conversational context across interactions to enable stateful agents. By the end, you will understand how these elements work together to create richer, multi-step applications that go beyond simple single-prompt interactions.


*The video below is a recap of what we covered in the previous module and also gives a brief introduction to the concepts of parsers and chains, which we will explore in more depth throughout this module.*

# **1. Understanding Chains**

Chains in LangChain are sequences of connected steps where the output of one component is passed as the input to the next, allowing you to build structured workflows with multiple LLM calls, tools, or processing stages.

For example, instead of relying on a single prompt to handle everything, you can design a chain where:

* Step 1 extracts key entities or topics from a user’s question
* Step 2 searches a knowledge base or external API using those entities
* Step 3 summarizes or reformats the retrieved results into a user-friendly response

This modular approach makes it easier to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts, improves control over each stage of the process, and enables dynamic branching or conditional logic (for example, adjusting the chain’s path depending on the user’s input or the model’s response).

Chains are essential for building sophisticated applications like question-answering systems, multi-step reasoning agents, or pipelines that integrate LLMs with other data sources and tools. As we progress through the module, you will learn not only how to use built-in chain types but also how to create custom chains tailored to your own workflows.
