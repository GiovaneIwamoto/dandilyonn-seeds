title: "Module 5: Graphs, ReAct Agents, LangSmith"
layout: post
---

This module focuses on advanced concepts for building and deploying robust AI agents using graph-based architectures. Learners will explore LangGraph for stateful agent construction, ReAct agent patterns, and integration with LangSmith for debugging and evaluation. The module also covers multi-agent systems, production-ready deployment strategies, and specialized tracks such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), autonomous agents, and application deployment with FastAPI and Streamlit. By the end of the module, learners will be prepared to design complex, scalable agent systems ready for real-world use.
