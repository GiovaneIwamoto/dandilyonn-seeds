Welcome to the first module of our AI Agent Development course! Before diving into creating intelligent agents, we need to set up our development environment. This guide will walk you through installing and configuring all the necessary tools you'll need throughout this course.

If you already have experience with Python development and have some of these tools installed (Python, VS Code, Git, etc.), feel free to skip the sections you're familiar with. Just make sure you have all the required libraries installed in your preferred environment. You can use the "Testing Your Setup" section at the end to verify everything is working correctly.


## What You'll Need

As we build AI agents, you'll be working with:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for AI development
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive code development and experimentation  
- **Visual Studio Code**: A powerful code editor with excellent Python support
- **Key Python Libraries**: Essential packages for AI agent development
- **Git**: For version control and code sharing
- **Virtual Environments**: To manage dependencies across different projects

Let's go through each component step by step.

## 1. Installing Python

Python is the foundation of our AI development stack. We'll use Python 3.9 or newer.

### Windows Installation

1. Visit the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest Python installer (3.9 or newer)
3. Run the installer
4. **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
5. Click "Install Now" for the standard installation

### macOS Installation

**Option 1: Using Homebrew (Recommended)**
1. If you don't have Homebrew, install it by opening Terminal and running:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Install Python using Homebrew:

```
brew install python
```

**Option 2: Direct Download**
1. Visit the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the macOS installer
3. Run the installer package and follow the instructions

### Linux Installation

Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. To check your version:

```
python3 --version
```

If you need to install or update:

**Ubuntu/Debian**:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

**Fedora**:

```
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
```

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify Python is correctly installed by opening your command line or terminal and typing:
```
python --version  # or python3 --version on macOS/Linux
```

You should see the Python version number displayed.

## 2. Setting Up Virtual Environments

Virtual environments are isolated spaces where you can install packages without affecting other Python projects. This is crucial for AI development where different projects may require different library versions.

### Installing and Creating a Virtual Environment

1. Open your command line/terminal
2. Install virtualenv:
```
pip install virtualenv
```

3. Create a project folder:
```
mkdir ai_agents_course
cd ai_agents_course
```

4. Create a virtual environment:
```
# Windows
python -m venv venv

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
```

5. Activate the virtual environment:
```
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

When activated, you'll see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

## 3. Installing Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful code editor with excellent Python support.

1. Visit the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Download and install the version for your operating system
3. Open VS Code after installation

### Essential VS Code Extensions for AI Development

Install these extensions from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X):

- **Python** by Microsoft: For Python language support
- **Jupyter**: For working with Jupyter notebooks directly in VS Code
- **Pylance**: Enhanced language server for Python
- **Python Indent**: For proper indentation in Python
- **GitLens**: For enhanced Git capabilities
- **Prettier**: For code formatting

## 4. Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks allow you to create and share documents containing live code, visualizations, and narrative text.

### Installing Jupyter

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated
2. Install Jupyter:

```
pip install notebook
```

### Using Jupyter with VS Code

1. Install the following extensions:

- Jupyter (extension ID: ms-toolsai.jupyter)
- Jupyter Notebook Renderers (extension ID: ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers)
- Jupyter Keymap (extension ID: ms-toolsai.jupyter-keymap)
- Jupyter Cell Tags (extension ID: ms-toolsai.vscode-jupyter-cell-tags)

- You can install these by:
    1. Clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X)
    2. Searching for "Jupyter"
    3. Installing each extension listed above

2. Open your project folder (File > Open Folder)
3. Create a new file with a .ipynb extension (File > New File, then save it with .ipynb extension)
4. Important: Selecting a Kernel
    - When you open a Jupyter notebook in VS Code, you'll see a "Select Kernel" button in the top-right corner
    - Click on it to choose your Python environment
    - Select the "Python (AI Agents Course)" kernel we created earlier
    - If you don't see it, you can select "Python Environments..." and navigate to your virtual environment

## 6. Installing Git

Git is essential for version control and collaboration.

### Windows
1. Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Run the installer with default options

### macOS
1. If you have Homebrew:

```
brew install git
```

2. Or install using the package from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

### Linux
```
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git

# Fedora
sudo dnf install git
```

### Configure Git
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Testing Your Setup

Let's make sure everything is working properly by creating a simple test:

1. Create a new Jupyter notebook in VS Code
2. In the first cell, add this code:

{% highlight python %}

import sys

# Print Python version to confirm installation
print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")

# Simple Python functionality test
def hello_ai():
    print("Hello, AI Agent Development World!")
    
    # Simple calculation
    result = sum(range(1, 11))
    print(f"Sum of numbers from 1 to 10: {result}")
    
    # Simple list manipulation
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    print(f"Original list: {fruits}")
    fruits.append("orange")
    print(f"List after adding an item: {fruits}")
    
    # Simple conditional statement
    name = "AI Developer"
    if len(name) > 5:
        print(f"The name '{name}' has more than 5 characters.")
    else:
        print(f"The name '{name}' has 5 or fewer characters.")

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}

# Call the function
hello_ai()

{% endhighlight %}

3. Run the cell to verify your installations

## What's Next?

Now that you have your development environment set up, you're ready to begin exploring AI agent development! In the upcoming modules, we'll:

1. Learn about fundamental concepts in AI agent development
2. Explore Large Language Models (LLMs) and their capabilities
3. Create your first simple AI agent
4. Connect agents to external tools and data sources
5. Build more complex, multi-agent systems

If you encounter any issues with this setup, please post in the course forum or contact the instructional team for assistance.

Happy coding!
