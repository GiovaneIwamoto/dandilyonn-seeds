Welcome to the first module of our AI Agent Development course! Before diving into creating intelligent agents, we need to set up our development environment. This guide will walk you through installing and configuring all the necessary tools you'll need throughout this course.

If you already have experience with Python development and have some of these tools installed (VS Code, Git, Jupyter Notebook), feel free to skip the sections you're familiar with. Just make sure everything is properly set up and working in your development environment before starting the course. You can use the "Testing Your Setup" section at the end to verify everything is working correctly.


## What You'll Need

As we build AI agents, you'll be working with:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for AI development
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive code development and experimentation  
- **Visual Studio Code**: A powerful code editor with excellent Python support
- **Git**: For version control and code sharing

Let's go through each component step by step.

## 1. Installing Python

Python is the foundation of our AI development stack.

### Installation

1. Visit the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest Python installer
3. Run the installer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify Python is correctly installed by opening your command line or terminal and typing:

```shell
python --version # Windows
python3 --version # MacOS/Linux
```

You should see the Python version number displayed.

## 2. Setting Up Virtual Environments

Virtual environments are isolated spaces where you can install packages without affecting other Python projects. This is crucial for AI development where different projects may require different library versions.

### Installing and Creating a Virtual Environment

When activated, you'll see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

## 3. Installing Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful code editor with excellent Python support.

- Visit the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Essential VS Code Extensions for AI Development

Install these extensions from the Extensions view `Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`:

- **Python** by Microsoft: For Python language support
- **Jupyter**: For working with Jupyter notebooks directly in VS Code
- **Pylance**: Enhanced language server for Python

## 4. Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks allow you to create and share documents containing live code, visualizations, and narrative text.

## 6. Installing Git

Git is essential for version control and collaboration.

### Windows
1. Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Run the installer with default options

### MacOS
```shell
brew install git
```

### Linux
```shell
sudo apt install git
```

### Configure Git
```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## 7. Testing Your Setup

Let's make sure everything is working properly by creating a simple test:

1. Create a new Jupyter notebook in VS Code
2. In the first cell, add this code:

{% highlight python %}

import sys

# Confirm Python is running correctly
print(f"[Dandilyonn Bootloader] Python detected: {sys.version.split()[0]} ðŸŒ±")

def activate_seedling_agent():
    print("\nðŸŒ¿ Initializing AI Agent Prototype: 'Seedling-01' under Project Dandilyonn...")
    
    # Simulated agent capabilities
    skills = ["reasoning", "retrieval", "tool use", "streaming output"]
    print(f"ðŸ§  Core capabilities loaded: {', '.join(skills)}")
    
    # Agent personality config
    agent_name = "Seedling-01"
    if "Seed" in agent_name:
        print(f"ðŸ¤– Agent '{agent_name}' recognized as part of early-stage growth units.")
    else:
        print(f"ðŸ¤– Agent '{agent_name}' does not follow standard naming conventions.")
    
    # Memory warmup
    recent_memories = ["Completed Langchain walkthrough", "Integrated vector search", "Deployed Streamlit prototype"]
    print("ðŸª´ Recent memory log:")
    for mem in recent_memories:
        print(f"  - {mem}")
    
    # Mission assignment
    mission = "Assist developers in building modular, stateful AI workflows with elegance."
    print(f"ðŸŽ¯ Mission assigned: {mission}")

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}

# Trigger the agent simulation
activate_seedling_agent()

{% endhighlight %}

## 8. What's Next?

Now that you have your development environment set up, you're ready to begin exploring AI agent development! In the upcoming modules, we'll:

1. Learn about fundamental concepts in AI agent development
2. Explore Large Language Models and their capabilities
3. Create your first simple AI agent
4. Connect agents to external tools and data sources
5. Build more complex, multi-agent systems

If you have any issues with the setup, feel free to reach outâ€”my contact email is available in the footer of this page.

Happy coding!

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Python Not Found After Installation
- **Windows**: Ensure Python is added to PATH
- **macOS/Linux**: Make sure you're using `python3` command

### Package Installation Failures
- Make sure your virtual environment is activated
- Try updating pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`

### VS Code Not Recognizing Python
- Make sure the Python extension is installed
- Select the correct interpreter (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P, then "Python: Select Interpreter")
