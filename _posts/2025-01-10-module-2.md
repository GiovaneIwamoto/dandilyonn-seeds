Discover the essential principles of Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, and Natural Language Processing — laying the groundwork for understanding Large Language Models and the rise of intelligent agents that are transforming industries, research, and everyday life.


## 1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

A broad overview of AI, its history, key domains, and the evolution from rule-based systems to data-driven learning.

Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze.

AI is a broad field that encompasses many different disciplines, including computer science, data analytics and statistics, hardware and software engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy and psychology. 
On an operational level for business use, AI is a set of technologies that are based primarily on machine learning and deep learning, used for data analytics, predictions and forecasting, object categorization, natural language processing, recommendations, intelligent data retrieval, and more.

## 2. From AI to Generative AI

Learn what makes GenAI different from traditional AI — focusing on systems that can create new content such as text, images, music, and code.

### 2.1 Understanding Generative AI

### 2.2 Generative vs. Discriminative Models
- **Discriminative Models**

Understand the conceptual and practical differences between generative models (which create data) and discriminative models (which classify or predict).

## 3. Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Delve into the fascinating challenge of teaching machines to understand and generate human language—exploring why this problem is uniquely difficult and how modern approaches are achieving breakthrough capabilities. 

Note: While the linked tutorials may contain coding examples, for this module you should focus on understanding the concepts and challenges of NLP rather than implementing code. The goal is to develop a strong conceptual foundation of why language processing is difficult for machines before attempting technical implementations in future modules.
